## Issue ruby-factory-bot #375


## Status da Issue
 Foi importado a nova upstream, mas houve um comentário para retirar uma patch do pacote:

 "Hi @Shaine_oliveira,
I see that @sergiosacj already did a good review (thanks!).
There's one small thing that I noticed and that might be worth looking into.  This package carries a patch (0005-skip-failing-test.patch) whose purpose is to disable a test that was failing.  The patch seems to have been created back in 2023, and I believe it's not needed anymore (I tried removing it, and the package still built fine).
Would you like to take a look and see if you can remove it, please?  Once you do it, I can sponsor the upload for you.
Thanks."
